# Enhancing Real Estate Price Predictions with Random Forest Regression üè°

This repository contains the code and analysis for predicting real estate prices using the **RandomForestRegressor** algorithm. The project leverages **ensemble learning** to enhance prediction accuracy, reduce overfitting, and improve generalization, making it a robust model for real estate price prediction.

## üìä Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a reliable model to predict real estate prices. Using **RandomForestRegressor**, we train multiple decision trees on random subsets of features and average their predictions. This approach helps reduce overfitting and captures important relationships between features.

### Key Steps:
1. **Automated Dataset Handling**:
   - Download and extract the dataset automatically.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze data distribution, correlations, and important features.
3. **Stratified Sampling**:
   - Ensure that training and test sets are representative of the population.
4. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Feature scaling, creation of new attributes (e.g., rooms per household, population per household), and custom transformations.
5. **Random Forest Regression**:
   - Apply the RandomForestRegressor to generate predictions and assess model performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills and Tools

- **Scikit-Learn**: Model building, feature engineering, and evaluation.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and transformations.
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: Visualizing data insights and model results.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends, correlations, and feature importance.

## üöÄ Workflow

1. **Data Download and Preprocessing**:
   - Automatically download the dataset and extract its contents.
   - Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and preprocess features.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new meaningful attributes like rooms per household and population per household.

3. **EDA**:
   - Visualize relationships between variables and understand the dataset better.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Apply **RandomForestRegressor** with hyperparameter tuning and evaluate performance using cross-validation.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess model accuracy and feature importance to identify key factors influencing real estate prices.

## üìà Results

By using RandomForestRegressor, the model provides accurate predictions for real estate prices and valuable insights into factors such as:

- Location
- Rooms per household
- Population per household
- Proximity to key amenities

These insights can be used to make informed decisions in the real estate market
